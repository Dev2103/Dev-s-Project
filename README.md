# Skyline Defence

This is the end…

A meteor strike has destined this planet for doom. But there is some hope. From the ashes, humanity has a chance of rebuilding. The government had been building underground bunkers for decades in preparation for a catastrophic global event like a nuclear fallout, but it turns out the biggest threat to humanity came form above. You have been tasked of defending our city for as long as possible. Buy the citizens enough time to load into the bunkers. Don’t let the meteors hit the streets.

I need you to know soldier. You and you platoon will not make it through this. This will be your last contribution and the most important. May your lives not be lost in vain.
